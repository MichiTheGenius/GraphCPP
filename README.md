# GraphCPP

A graph implementation written in C++. This project was inspired by a school project, where I had to implement a graph in Java. But because I want to learn C++ I converted it to C++!

## Usage
- clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/MichiTheGenius/GraphCPP.git
    ```
- open the `graph.cpp` file inside your text editor of choice and look at the availabe methods
- open the `main.cpp` file and write the methods you want to run inside
- run the `comp.sh` script to compile `main.cpp` and run it
    ```sh
    ./comp.sh
    ```
